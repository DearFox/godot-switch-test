# Godot for Switch test

It's a port of the Godot open source game engine to the Switch, via homebrew libraries provided by devkitPro/switchbrew.
See the original README-original.md for info about Godot.

## Releases
See [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Stary2001/godot/releases) for pre-built editors for Windows, macOS and Linux.

## How do I export my game?
The editor builds above add a `Switch` exporter to the list - it will generate a .nro and a .pck file that can be transferred to your Switch.
If additional debugging is required, sending the nro via nxlink (make sure to send it to the right place with the -p argument) will allow the output of the console to be viewed on PC.

## How to build?
You shouldn't need to build the engine if you use a release as the templates should be included - these instructions are for development!

[See the official docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/)
for compilation instructions for every officially supported platform.

### For Switch:

Install these packages from [devkitPro pacman](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman):
`switch-pkg-config switch-freetype switch-bulletphysics switch-libtheora switch-libpcre2 switch-mesa switch-opusfile switch-mbedtls switch-libwebp switch-libvpx switch-miniupnpc switch-libzstd switch-wslay`
then run `scons platform=switch` in the root of the repo. Add `target=release` to build for release instead of debug.

Then, to build an engine release for Switch,
run `./scripts/create-switch-release.sh` in the root of the repo.

Or to build an export template for the editor,
run `./scripts/create-switch-template.sh` in the root of the repo.
